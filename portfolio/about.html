                <p>After graduating from Western Kentucky University in 2014 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Public Relations, I've spent the last four years working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as part of a team in various companies in Louisville, Kentucky. I acquired technical, project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.</p>
                <p>As a freelance web developer and designer I collaborated with several businesses in Louisville and Lexington, at the same time maintaining clients in Southern Indiana and Florida. I also mentor front-end development students at <a href="https://www.codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a>, and have completed both the Front-end Development and C# tracks through that program.</p>
                <p>I have worked on a multitude of web based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (HTML, CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery, AngularJS/2/4, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), eCommerce Solutions, and Graphic Design. During my Public Relations degree I minored in Marketing, and therefore have a keen understanding of how user experience, analytics and business logic impact design experience. I am adept at building wireframes, sitemaps and user experience design which I put to good use on every project I work on.</p>
                <p>I am currently working in Louisville, KY. I am always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype. These days I enjoy spending my free time practicing yoga, cooking and traveling (everywhere!).</p>
